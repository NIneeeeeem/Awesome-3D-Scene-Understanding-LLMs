# 🤝 Contributing
We sincerely welcome paper updates/ contributions of any kind (and please do that lol)! Feel free to *open issues* or *create pull requests*. <br> 

## Adding New Papers
If you want to add new papers to the existing list, please modify the README.md and follow the format in the table:

```markdown
| year/month  | [Title of the Paper](Arxiv Link)  | <img width="700" alt="image" src="img/name.png"> | [Github](Github Link) |
```

### Recommended Guidelines:
- Detect the earliest date of the paper, and place it properly in ascending order of the date.
- If possible, use arXiv links rather than links from other resources (e.g. conference page), and provide link to the *abstract* instead of PDF page.
- If the paper is accepted by a conference or journal, please add tag ![NAME'YEAR](https://img.shields.io/badge/NAME'YEAR-f1b800). See existing cases.
- An introduction must be added in the /imgs folder, which should be the overview of the method. Keep it as aesthetically pleasing as possible; avoid leaving too much blank space.
- If the Github link is available, please add it; otherwise, use "-" instead.
